#### Folders and files which you need to configure and localize
    /config - your configuration folder, you can create as many profiles for as many envs as needed
    /projectSpecific - folder for both definitions and methods which are project unique
    /tests - your main wrapper for feature folders and files
    multilingualStrings.js - string translations


### Minimum node and yarn versions needed
    Node - v18 (Recommended v20)
    Yarn - v1.22

### Project structure
    config - configuration profiles, separated on folders by environment
    features - Has 3 folders
        lib - Main function definitions
        support - Step defitions, hooks and components

#### {env} is the folder name in the config dir
    yarn test {profile} {env} - all tests
    yarn test {profile} {env} features/tests/<test> - specific test
    
#### Example - will run all tests using the exampleProfile from the dev folder
    yarn test exampleProfile dev
